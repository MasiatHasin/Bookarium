# Bookarium- An Online Bookstore

This is a website for an online bookstore which has a wide collection of books. Customers can filter and sort books based on different characteristics. Book samples and reviews can make it easier for customers to find the right book for themselves or a loved one. Initially, this website was built as a project for the CSE470 course of BRAC University but some additions and improvements have been made later on.
